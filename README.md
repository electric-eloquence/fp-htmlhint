# HTMLHint extension for Fepper

### This package has been DEPRECATED.

This package will no longer receive updates and will eventually be deleted.

Deep within the dependency hierarchy, lies 
<a href="https://app.snyk.io/test/npm/shelljs" target="_blank">a command injection vulnerabilty</a>. 
The actually vulnerability only affects development use-cases, but it does not 
look like those cases will get fixed or removed, however fixable or however 
optional they may be. As such, the vulnerability warning will probably never go 
away.

Please use [fp-htmllint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fp-htmllint) instead.
